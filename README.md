# BackupScripts with Restic and Rclone

# Project Documentation

## Introduction

Welcome to the Backup Scripts repository! This project aims to provide a set of shell scripts that facilitate the backup process of a folder structure using two powerful tools: Restic and Rclone.

Restic is an efficient and secure backup program that deduplicates, compresses, and encrypts data. It supports various backends, allowing backups to be stored locally or in the cloud. Rclone, on the other hand, is a command-line program that enables syncing and transferring of files between different storage providers, such as cloud storage services, FTP servers, and more.

Only basic command line knowledge is required for use and installation. Restic and Rclone are installed exclusively via the official docker containers of the respective projects. The scripts are not connected to Restic or Rclone. No liability is assumed for the use or loss of data.

The combination of Restic and Rclone offers a flexible and robust solution for performing backups, ensuring the safety and integrity of your data. The scripts provided in this repository simplify the configuration and execution of backup operations, making it easier for you to set up and maintain a reliable backup system.

### Features
Local and Remote Backups: The scripts support both local and remote backup scenarios. You can choose to back up your data to a local directory or utilize various cloud storage providers supported by Rclone.
Incremental Backups: Restic performs efficient incremental backups by identifying changes in files, minimizing storage requirements and network bandwidth usage.
Encryption and Security: Restic encrypts your data before it is stored, ensuring privacy and security. The encryption key is securely stored and managed by Restic.
Configurable Retention Policies: You can customize the retention policies to specify how long backups should be kept, allowing you to balance storage usage and backup history.
Notification Support: The scripts can be configured to send notifications via email or other methods upon completion or failure of backup operations, keeping you informed about the backup status.
