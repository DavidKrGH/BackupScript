# Configuration for Docker containers that are stopped during the backup and started again afterwards.
#
# Format:
# Add Container to start/stop
# + ContainerName_or_ID
#
# Exclude Container from start/stop
# - ContainerName_or_ID
#
# Behavior:
# The list is processed from top to bottom.
# The first entry in the list is stopped/started first.
# When "reverse_docker_start_sequence" is set to "true", the list is processed in reverse order for starting.
# Comments and empty lines are ignored.
# If no containers are to be stopped, the file can be left empty.


# Examples:

# Add individual containers to proceed in a specific order
+ FirstContainerToStop
+ SecondContainerToStop

# Use pattern:
# Adds "Container" "Container-Server" "Container-Database"
+ Contai*

# Adds "Container1-Server" "Container2-Server"; Dose not add "Container-Database"
+ Contai*-Server


# To stop all containers or all remaining ones.
+ *


# Excluded explicitly from starting and stopping. 
- ContainerName
- Contai*
- Contai*-Server
