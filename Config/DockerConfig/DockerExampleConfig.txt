# Configuration for Docker containers that are stopped during the backup and started again afterwards.
#
# Format:
# + container_name_or_id -> container to start/stop
# - container_name_or_id -> container to exclude from start/stop
#
# Behavior:
# The list is processed from top to bottom.
# The first entry in the list is stopped/started first.
# When using the "reverse" function, the list is processed in reverse order for starting.
# Comments and empty lines are ignored.


# Example:

# Add individual containers to proceed in a specific order
+ ContainerName
+ abcdefg12345

# Use pattern:
# Adds "Container" "Container-Server" "Container-Database"
+ Cont*

# Adds "Container-Private" "Container-Server-Private"; Dose not add "Container-Database"
+ Cont*-Private


# To stop all containers or all remaining ones.
+ *


# Excluded explicitly from starting and stopping. 
- ContainerName
- abcdefg12345
- Cont*
- Cont*-Private
